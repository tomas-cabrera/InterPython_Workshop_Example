## Quick Start

I recommend you going to the [documentation site](https://jupyterlab-code-formatter.readthedocs.io/#quick-start), but this should work too.

1. **Install the package**

```bash
pip install jupyterlab-code-formatter
```

2. **Install some supported formatters** (isort+black are default for Python)

```bash
# NOTE: Install black and isort,
#       JL code formatter is configured to invoke isort and black by default
pip install black isort
```

3. **Restart JupyterLab**

This plugin includes a server plugin, restart JupyterLab if you have followed the above steps while it's running.

4. **Configure plugin**

To configure which/how formatters are invoked, see [configuration](https://jupyterlab-code-formatter.readthedocs.io/configuration.html).
